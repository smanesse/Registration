README 
The purpose of this script is to get you registered for USU classes before the people in your group.
Run this script 5-6 minutes before your time opens. Make sure you have no holds on your account or
any other things to sign or roadblocks that the script might not account for. The script will give you
20 seconds to use duo if you need. Only send the request, authorize through your phone, and the
script will do the rest.
